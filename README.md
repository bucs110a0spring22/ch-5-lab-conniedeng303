## SUMMARY:
 < I first created functions that created the window's coordinates, a circle, square, and axis. Then I created the isInCircle function to change the color of a dot depending if it is outside or inside the dartboard. I used this function to create the throwDarts function, which picks a random point for the turtle to go to.To keep track of points for different players, I alternated turns by determining if the current range is even or odd.Finally, for the last part, I created the montePi function to keep track of the darts that landed inside the circle (used distance method). This function returns the approximation for pi by dividing the total darts that landed inside the circle, with the total amount of darts. And then multiplying this value with 4 to get pi's approximation.>
